Amidst bloodshed and death, demons possess the partiers, turning their bodies into grotesque monsters, and begin wreaking havoc. In a reckless attempt to save his best friend, Akira unwittingly merges with the devil Amon and becomes a Devilman, gaining the power to defeat the remaining demons.\\n\\nThough it grants him great power, this new partnership awakens an insatiable and primeval part of Akira. Having the body of a devil but the same crybaby heart, Akira works alongside Ryou, destroying those that harm humanity and his loved ones.\\n\\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\",\n    'mean': 7.75,\n    'rank': 1152,\n    'popularity': 125,\n    'nsfw': 'white',\n    'genres': [{'id': 1, 'name': 'Action'},\n     {'id': 5, 'name': 'Avant Garde'},\n     {'id': 58, 'name': 'Gore'},\n     {'id': 14, 'name': 'Horror'},\n     {'id': 6, 'name': 'Mythology'},\n     {'id': 27, 'name': 'Shounen'},\n     {'id': 37, 'name': 'Supernatural'}],\n    'media_type': 'ona',\n    'status': 'finished_airing',\n    'num_episodes': 10,\n    'start_season': {'year': 2018, 'season': 'winter'},\n    'source': 'manga',\n    'average_episode_duration': 1489,\n    'rating': 'r+',\n    'studios': [{'id': 1591, 'name': 'Science SARU'}]},\n   'list_status': {'status': 'plan_to_watch',\n    'score': 0,\n    'num_episodes_watched': 0,\n    'is_rewatching': False,\n    'updated_at': '2021-01-29T13:11:41+00:00'}},\n  {'node': {'id': 54857,\n    'title': 'Re:Zero kara Hajimeru Isekai Seikatsu 3rd Season',\n    'main_picture': {'medium': 'https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1706/144725.jpg',\n     'large': 'https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1706/144725l.jpg'},\n    'synopsis': 'Third season of Re:Zero kara Hajimeru Isekai Seikatsu.',\n    'mean': 8.86,\n    'rank': 29,\n    'popularity': 886,\n    'nsfw': 'white',\n    'genres': [{'id': 8, 'name': 'Drama'},\n     {'id': 10, 'name': 'Fantasy'},\n     {'id': 62, 'name': 'Isekai'},\n     {'id': 40, 'name': 'Psychological'},\n     {'id': 41, 'name': 'Suspense'},\n     {'id': 78, 'name': 'Time Travel'}],\n    'media_type': 'tv',\n    'status': 'currently_airing',\n    'num_episodes': 16,\n    'start_season': {'year': 2024, 'season': 'fall'},\n    'source': 'light_novel',\n    'average_episode_duration': 1420,\n    'rating': 'r',\n    'studios': [{'id': 314, 'name': 'White Fox'}]},\n   'list_status': {'status': 'watching',\n    'score': 0,\n    'num_episodes_watched': 0,\n    'is_rewatching': False,\n    'updated_at': '2024-11-04T22:42:46+00:00'}},\n  {'node': {'id': 54865,\n    'title': 'Blue Lock vs. U-20 Japan',\n    'main_picture': {'medium': 'https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1584/144860.jpg',\n     'large': 'https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1584/144860l.jpg'},\n    'synopsis': 'The next phase of the controversial Blue Lock project is underway with the candidate pool being dwindled down to just 35.

Among the ones left in the running is Yoichi Isagi, who is coming to terms with his own abilities.\\n\\nTo further complicate matters, the six best players in the pool have already been named to the starting lineup and the remaining 29 will have to duke it out to claim a coveted spot. Each candidate must select a top six pairing to team up with for the selection to prove their competence.
